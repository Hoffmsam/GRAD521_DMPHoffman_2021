# Data Description
The question I am looking to answer with my dataset is if two different vineyard management techniques can mitigate any effects on the sensory characteristics of Pinot Noir infected with Grapevine Red Blotch Virus (GRBV). GRBV has been shown to affect the vine’s ability to mature leading to grapes that never reach their final ripeness. The industry believes that wine made from these grapes will be lesser in quality, however this has not been completely proven. Regardless, the mitigation of any effects is imperative, and thus this research looks to utilize vineyard management techniques to mitigate any perceived change. GRBV has shown to have a large seasonality component to it, meaning is its impacts varies from year to year. Thus, this experiment was conducted over two year during the 2018 and 2019 harvest.
## Sensory Data
Sensory data is also experimental data and will be collected using the Compusense® sensory software system. The preference testing uses a 9-point hedonic scale ranging, one to nine from extremely dislike too extremely like. Color testing uses a custom-made color scale ranging from pink to red to purple. The scale is placed above a 9-point scale and panelists were asked to select the number that best corresponds to the color of the wine. Aroma analysis uses a method known as Check-All-That-Apply where the panelist smells the wine and selects all the corresponding aromas from a predetermined provided lexicon. Finally, mouthfeel uses a method known as Just-About-Right (JAR). JAR askes the panelist to rate the wine for a given attribute one a 5-point scale. The one on the scale corresponds to “too little” of the attribute while five corresponds to “too much” of the attribute, while a response of three corresponds to the attribute being “Just About Right”. Sensory data is stored within the Compusense® system and is accessible for download into spreadsheets. Data is then deidentified by the PI of the project and sent to me for analysis.
## Sensory Data Size & File Type
The sensory data consists of one to five responses for each of the eight to nine wines for each of the panelists (40 for the 2018 samples, 53 for 2019) for each of the four methods. This corresponds to a few hundred data points for each year. The compiled deidentified spreadsheet is currently just over one MB in size.
## Analytical Data
This project will generate multiple datasets that will be compiled into aggregate data sets for analysis and comparison. First, non-sensory data will be collected on both the grape juice prior to fermentation, and the wine post fermentation. This data will be used for physiochemical analysis which will give context to the wines prior to sensor. The data for the juice will consist of readings for ⁰Brix, pH, Titratable Acidity, and Yeast Assimilable Nitrogen. The wine data will consist of pH, Titratable Acidity, Polymeric Pigment, Color Density, Color Intensity, Color Shade, and Ethanol. All this data is experimental data. Instrumentation used to collect data is standard laboratory equipment for pH, and Titratable Acidity. Yeast Assimilable Nitrogen requires enzymatic analysis, and a spectrophotometer. Polymeric Pigment, and all the color methods also require the spectrophotometer. Finally, Ethanol utilizes an Anton Paar Alcolyzer which is based off density measurements. The data collected via carrying out the respective analytical method and recording the results in a laboratory notebook, then transferring it to a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel for analysis. 
## Analytical Data Size & File Type
For the physicochemical data will consist of results for each analysis preformed for each treatment group in triplicate for each of the two years the test was performed. This results in one to two hundred pieces of physicochemical data per year. The file sizes of the corresponding spreadsheets are under one MB. 
# Roles and responsibilities
## Data Manager
This also falls to the PI as she is the one who is responsible for the data management plan. Additionally, she oversees all data generation, access, analysis, and distribution.
## DMP Implementation
This is the responsibility of the PI, as she prepares and maintains all IRB’s.
## Protection of Sensitive and Protected Data
The fall primarily to the Lab Manager as she is responsible for panelist onboarding, and deidentifying data.
## Data Collection/Data Generation
This is the responsibility of the Grad Student in charge of the experiment.
## Metadata Generation
This falls to the Lab Manager who oversees demographic information and panelist recruitment.
## Data Analysis
The Grad Student oversees the data analysis for the project. The PI will assist only when necessary, for example the methodology is beyond the understanding of the graduate student at that time. 
## Quality Control
This falls on the Grad Student to recognize errors while administering the test, or large errors in the reported data. Additionally, they are there to ensure that no implicit bias is present.
## Archiving and Preservation
For the methods used this done using the Compusense® software system which stores the data indefinitely within its cloud system. This responsibility falls to the PI.
## Instrumentation Maintenance 
This is dependent on the instrumentation in need of maintenance. Sensory equipment falls under the responsibility of the Lab Manager, while analytical equipment is the responsibility of the PI.
## Access Control
Access to the Compusense® system is maintained by the Lab Manager.
## Software Creation and Maintenance
Software is not created for this, or any project. The contract allowing usage of the Compusense system is maintained by the PI. 
# Data standards and metadata
## Data & Metadata Standards
### Sensory Standards
Currently the field of Sensory Science does not have any formalized standards for data or metadata. Therefore, it is not that there are no adequate disciplinary standards for the study, there simply are none. This is because the field as a whole has not embraced the open sharing of data, thus so few studies implement data sharing there is little demand for standards. While there are no formal standards for data and/or metadata, there is expected metadata information that is required for all publications. These metadata requirements consist of the demographic information of the panelists taking part in the sensory study, as well as the testing conditions in which the sensory study takes place.
### Psychophysical Standards
Data and/or Metadata for psychophysical analysis is controlled by recording the results in the standards covered within the MCPHS labarchives Lab Notebook Metadata standards
## Metadata Generation
### Sensory Metadata
The metadata that is generated during this project will be collected via a screening survey conducted prior to the sensory test, that will also determine panelist eligibility. The information collected in the screen will consist of: Biological gender, age, average wine consumption per week, smoker status, pregnancy status, and anosmic status. This survey will be conducted via the Compusense® system and be available as a report in the form of a csv file to the Lab Manager. Demographic information will be provided to the author of the publication for the product, only after deidentification performed by the Lab Manager.
### Psychophysical Metadata
Psychophysical metadata will be generated via benchtop analysis following relevant analytical methodologies. Psychophysical testing will be following standardized ISO methods when available, and acceptable testing methodology for the field when ISO methods unavailable.
# Storage and security
## Data Storage
### Sensory Data
Raw Data is stored on the Compusense® cloud system, deidentified data can be downloaded in the form of spreadsheets to be used for data analysis. Spreadsheets are stored on the laboratory Box drive.
### Psychophysical Data
Psychophysical raw data is generated and stored within laboratory notebooks kept physically within the laboratory. Data is then transferred onto spreadsheets for data analysis and stored within the laboratory Box drive. 
## Security & Backup
### Sensory Data
The information is secured within the Compusense® cloud system. Access to which is only available to those granted access by the Lab Manger and requires 2 factor authentication upon every log in to the system. Additionally, all identifying information is only visible to the Lab Manger and PI. The only other users of the system are Grad Students. 

All raw data is backed up on the Compusense® cloud system. Spreadsheets and other data copies stored on the laboratory Box drive are backed up on the laboratory’s server located within the PI’s office once a week.  The laboratory server is manually backed up once a week and does not use any special programs. Access to the laboratory Box drive can only be granted by the Lab Manager or the PI.
### Psychophysical Data
Laboratory notebooks are physically stored within the laboratory, which remains locked at all times. Laboratory notebooks are not to be removed from the lab at any time. Spreadsheets consisting of psychophysical data are stored on the same laboratory Box drive as the sensory data.
## Organization & Version Control
Sensory data generated using the Compusense® system is exported into Excel spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet contains the results of a single method conducted and will be named in the following structure: SensoryPanelName_NameofTestMethod_Date_Version. For example, WineConsumerRedBlotchStudy_AromaCATA_05072021_v1. Data will be stored in the project folder contained within the Data folder within the shared Box drive. 

Version tracking will be done using the version number scheme located on the file name. Additionally, any changes made will be recorded on the change log created within the spreadsheet (this is a tab located within the spreadsheet in which the date and nature of the change is recorded).

Psychophysical data will be named in a similar fashion, following the format of Projectname_NameofTestMethod_Date_Version. Psychophysical data will follow the same version control methods.
# Access and data sharing
## Availability
Data will be made available at the time of publication. The data will be available by its inclusion in the supplemental materials section of the publication. The publication and subsequent data will be hosted on the American Journal of Enology and Viticulture website. The supplemental materials section is used as neither the sensory or enology fields have widely available data repositories for use at this time. All open access

Both Sensory and psychophysical data, as well as related deidentified metadata will all be available as csv files within the supplemental materials sections.

Data will be standardized in terms headings, units (SI), and structure within spreadsheets. Separate spreadsheets will be available for different testing methodologies for ease of use.
## Privacy
The sensory metadata contains identifying information and is thus considered sensitive information. Therefore, this information will not be provided, and access to the information will not be granted to any person outside the Lab Manager or PI. Deidentified demographic information will be available within the metadata supplied in the supplemental materials section of the publication.

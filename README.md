# GRAD521_DMPHoffman_2021

Context of the project for the DMP: 

The question I am looking to answer with my dataset is if two different vineyard management techniques can mitigate any effects on the sensory characteristics of Pinot Noir infected with Grapevine Red Blotch Virus (GRBV). GRBV has been shown to affect the vineâ€™s ability to mature leading to grapes that never reach their final ripeness. The industry believes that wine made from these grapes will be lesser in quality, however this has not been completely proven. Regardless, the mitigation of any effects is imperative, and thus this research looks to utilize vineyard management techniques to mitigate any perceived change. GRBV has shown to have a large seasonality component to it, meaning is its impacts varies from year to year. Thus, this experiment was conducted over two year during the 2018 and 2019 harvest.
